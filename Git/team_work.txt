conflicts in github
# Sometimes working as team we wil have conflicts in the code since working with branches
# conflicts happen when you have an open PR, but someone else merges their PRs before you, 
and are updating the same lines of code 

# what to do now?

    $ git fetch --all && git merge origin/main   

# and fix the conflict locally

# OR:  

    $ git reset --hard HEAD  # to blow away merge conflicts


// but its better to fix locally if complex...
github - can fix merge conflicts -- diff (if same line changes)

hello
<<<<<<< feature/branch2
this is also a change from b2
=======
this is a change from b1
>>>>>>> main



- to fix conflicts locally:
$ git fetch --all && git merge origin/main  # local main branch would still be behind



$ git fetch --all # updates all remote branches in my local ??? I am 90% sure
